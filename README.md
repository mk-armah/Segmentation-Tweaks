# Developing and Optimizing Variants of Image Segmentation Architectures
<hr/>

This repository is specifically for research purposes with the intent of optimizing state of the art Image Segmentation
Architectures for Speed or Accuracy or both where possible. 
The idea is to rebuild state of the art architectures from scratch using latest advancements in AI and Computer Vision while maintaining the 
overall concept and interpretability of the architecture under study.
